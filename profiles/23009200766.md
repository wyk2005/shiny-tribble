## Expectations for this cource
As a software engineering student, my expectations for the "Open Source Software Development Practice" course are very high. I believe it will be one of the most practical and valuable courses in my entire curriculum.

First and foremost, I'm excited to move beyond theoretical assignments and individual coding exercises. I'm eager to get hands-on experience with a *real-world codebase*. I want to understand the initial feeling of being overwhelmed by a large, existing project and learn the strategies to navigate it, like reading documentation, tracing through code, and understanding the architecture. This is a crucial skill that's hard to learn from scratch in a classroom.

Secondly, I'm looking forward to mastering the tools and workflows that are industry standards but are often only touched upon briefly in other courses. I hope to gain deep, practical proficiency in:
*   **Git and Collaborative Workflows:** Not just basic commits, but effectively using branching strategies like GitFlow, creating meaningful pull requests, and conducting proper code reviews.
*   **Issue Tracking:** Learning to manage tasks using systems like GitHub Issues or Jira—from triaging bug reports to contributing to feature discussions.
*   **CI/CD Pipelines:** I want to understand how to set up and interact with automated testing and deployment pipelines, which are the backbone of modern software development.

Furthermore, I'm genuinely interested in the "soft skills" of open source. I want to learn how to communicate effectively and professionally within a developer community. This includes asking clear questions, providing constructive feedback, and respectfully discussing different technical approaches. Understanding the social dynamics and the etiquette of open-source communities is something I know will be invaluable for my future career, whether I work in a large tech company or a startup.

Finally, I see this course as a fantastic opportunity to start building my public portfolio. A meaningful contribution to a reputable open-source project is far more impressive on a resume than a standard school project. It demonstrates initiative, collaboration skills, and the ability to work with a team of experienced programmers.
