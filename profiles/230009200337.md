Hi, I'm Wuchen Wu.  
I'm currently a junior majoring in software engineering. I joined the Open Source Software Development Practice course because I’m fascinated by how open collaboration builds creative and practical tools — and the instructor’s enthusiasm for gaming really resonates with me.  
I enjoy exploring open source projects that make computer use more fun and efficient, and I hope to contribute to or create my own open source applications in the near future.
