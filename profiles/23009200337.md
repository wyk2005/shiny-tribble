Hi, I'm Muchen Wu<img width="48" height="48" alt="05967D33" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7844a59d-44a5-41a2-8727-ecd752d2aa65" />
.  
I'm currently a junior majoring in software engineering. I joined the Open Source Software Development Practice course because I’m fascinated by how open collaboration builds creative and practical tools — and the instructor’s enthusiasm for gaming really resonates with me.  
I enjoy exploring open source projects that make computer use more fun and efficient, and I hope to contribute to or create my own open source applications in the near future.
