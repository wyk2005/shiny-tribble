- **Expectation for this course:**
  I expect this course to move me from “user” to “contributor” in one semester: by running a public, collaborative repo where we practice real forks, PRs, reviews and CI; by teaching the etiquette of upstream communities so my first patch gets merged; and by guiding me to publish a small package that an interviewer can actually install—so I finish with a green contribution graph, a merged PR, and the confidence to call myself an open-source maintainer.
- **Interested open source projects:**
  Games are where code meets magic: I’m obsessed with how open-source engines like Godot, Bevy and Phaser turn imagination into interactive worlds. I want to spend the term inside that pipeline—profiling frame spikes, patching sprite-batch leaks, adding controller glyphs, and writing editor plug-ins that let future devs drag-and-drop a boss fight in five minutes. My dream outcome: a tiny PR that shaves 2 ms off the render loop gets merged, and a one-page post-mortem that teaches the next contributor why those 2 ms matter.
